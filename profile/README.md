## About us
The Weber Lab aims to improve our understanding of how the brain develops in infants and how certain neurological disorders can affect this development. Through the use of advanced MRI techniques, the lab has been able to non-invasively study the brain structure and function of infants and children with a range of neurological conditions.

By studying brain development, we hope to identify early markers of these conditions and develop better treatment strategies. We have already made significant progress in this area, and our research has led to a better understanding of the underlying causes of several pediatric neurological disorders (traumatic brain injuries, preterm birth, spinal cord injury, white matter injuries, and more).
Furthermore, the lab works closely with doctors, researchers, and other specialists to ensure that our research is conducted in the most effective and responsible way possible.

The impact of this research program is significant, as it has the potential to improve the lives of children and families affected by neurological disorders. By identifying early markers of these conditions and developing more effective treatments, the Weber Lab hopes to improve the prognosis for children with these conditions and reduce the burden of these disorders on families and society.
